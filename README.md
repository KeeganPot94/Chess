A chess game created to practice coding fundamentals.

What I learned:

- The implementation of the threads class and runnable interface.
- BufferedImage to import images and Enum - a special class to represent constants.
- Resource Root (IntelliJ)/ Source Folder (Eclipse)/ Workspace (VS Code) functionality to import media files.

Future Improvements:

- Display possible movement positions after clicking on a piece to move.
