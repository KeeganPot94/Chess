A chess game created to practice coding fundamentals

What I learned:

* The implementation of the threads class and runnable interface.
* BufferedImage.
* Resource Root (IntelliJ)/  Source Folder (Eclipse)/ Workspace (VS Code) functionality to import media files.

Known bugs:
* Castling to the left causes the game to crash - moved value is null

Future Improvements:
* Display possible movement positions after clicking on a piece to move
